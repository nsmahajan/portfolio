In that time she not only learned the legacy jQuery based UI to add new functionality, but has also been a driver to evaluate and use new UI frameworks.  Neha works extremely well within the development department, and across other departments as well - she single-handedly brought 3 key features from requirements through to prototypes, and implementation.  She is a tenacious worker that strives to not only solve the problem at hand, but also to understand the underlying principles in order to apply them later.
              Utilidata has been lucky to have Neha, our product line is better because of her.</div>

                Neha is one of the best colleague that I have worked with. She has logical and fact-based approach to problem-solving and her recommendations/guidance are based on thorough evaluation and analysis. <br>Neha is highly process driven and does not compromise with her value system. Her strength is to challenge an idea, debate the same to put her points logically and implement sincerely. <br>She is hard working, enthusiastic, good person and has all the qualities that makes her an asset for a company...... You are best Neha :)

                When I think of Neha, what come to my mind is a very reliable person, not just professionally but also personally.<br> 
                She completely puts her focus on the problem that needs to be solved, thinks of a solution to the problem and builds the solution in a way that is reusable in most other situations.<br>
                She can communicate well with the team members that she works with and is able to understand any kind of problems/challenges that the team members are facing and help them to overcome their problems/challenges.<br>
                She faces all the challenges that come her way head-on and manages her team efficiently to overcome the challenges like a Leader.
                I've seen her work in high stress situations without loosing her composure.<br>
                It has always been a pleasure working with you Neha, and I would be only too happy to work with you again.
